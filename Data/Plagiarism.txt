It's important to know what plagiarism is, and what form it takes (some common types of plagiarism are listed here). It's also important to know how plagiarism happens. The final step is to develop effective academic skills. Many students who plagiarise do so unintentionally, often because they don't have the academic skills to avoid over-reliance on the work of others or because they aren't sure what constitutes plagiarism. So it's important to take every opportunity to develop your academic skills.
